## üêæ Petgo Grooming Appointment Booking & Profile Logging
For this project, the objective was to mimic an online platform that could use a Visual Basic Application to fill their data reporting needs. The grooming scheduling platform I chose was Petco, fulfilling the minimum 7-8 Excel VBA skills required to achieve an A for this assignment. This first sheet is the user-form by clients to book their dogs grooming appointment. 

Data is organized into three sheets including Pet Profile Information, Owner Profile Information & an Appointment Information Database. Profile information can retrieved via the assigned ClientID number from the corresponding databases.

The confirmation information has been automated to print on a separate page, print to PDF/local printer and emailed to the client, upon request. There is also a captcha requirement put in place upon sending this receipt.

Functions have been implemented to calculated total estimated costs based on various pricing across the selected services, upgrades or add-ons. Most option selections are visible by dropdown, ActiveX control buttons, checkboxes, or require manual input from the user. The input data for these buttons is hidden in a separate sheet.
